Task: Binary Classification for Banking Dataset. Data Description here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing

NOTE: Using statsmodel will give you easier access to the violations of classical assumptions.

To do:

Apply all visualizations relevant for a discrete target variable.

Write your hypothesis based on visualization analyses.

Encode variables appropriately (try different encoders and see which one is best)

Fit your model using logistic regression

Calculate precision and recall and AUC-ROC

Identify any multicollinearity etc. and try and remove problematic variables.

Post going through basic test (p-value, vif, breush pagan) and fixing for them;
